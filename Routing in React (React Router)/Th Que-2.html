<!-- Explain the difference between BrowserRouter, Route, Link, and Switch components in React Router. -->

React Router Components:-

React Router provides several components to manage client-side routing in React applications. Here's a breakdown of the differences between BrowserRouter, Route, Link, and Switch components:

BrowserRouter
- Purpose: BrowserRouter is the top-level component that enables client-side routing in a React application.
- Functionality: It uses the HTML5 history API to manage the URL and keep the UI in sync with the URL.
- Usage: Wrap the entire application with BrowserRouter to enable client-side routing.

Route
- Purpose: Route is used to define a route in the application.
- Functionality: It renders a component when the URL matches the specified path.
- Usage: Use Route to define routes in the application, specifying the path and the component to render.

Link
- Purpose: Link is used to create links between routes in the application.
- Functionality: It uses the HTML5 history API to navigate between routes without requiring a full page reload.
- Usage: Use Link to create links between routes, specifying the path to navigate to.

Switch
- Purpose: Switch is used to render the first matching Route or Redirect component.
- Functionality: It ensures that only one route is rendered, even if multiple routes match the URL.
- Usage: Use Switch to wrap multiple Route components, ensuring that only one route is rendered.
