What is Redux?

Redux is a state management library that helps manage global state by providing a single source of truth for state. It's commonly used in React
applications to manage complex state logic and make it easier to debug and test.

Why Use Redux in React Applications?
Redux is used in React applications for several reasons:

- Global state management: Redux provides a centralized store for managing global state, making it easier to access and update state across the 
  application.
- Predictable state changes: Redux ensures that state changes are predictable and follow a strict set of rules, making it easier to debug and test
  the application.
- Decoupling components: Redux helps to decouple components from each other, making it easier to reuse and test components in isolation.

Core Concepts
The core concepts of Redux include:

Actions
- Definition: Actions are payloads that trigger state changes in the Redux store.
- Purpose: Actions are used to describe what happened in the application, and they trigger the reducer to update the state.

Reducers
- Definition: Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.
- Purpose: Reducers specify how the state should be updated in response to an action.

Store
- Definition: The store is the central location that holds the application's state.
- Purpose: The store provides a single source of truth for the application's state, and it allows components to access and update the state.

How Redux Works
Here's a high-level overview of how Redux works:

1. Component dispatches an action: A component dispatches an action to the Redux store.
2. Reducer updates the state: The reducer receives the action and updates the state accordingly.
3. Store notifies components: The store notifies components that are subscribed to the state change.
4. Components update: Components update their state based on the new state from the store.

Benefits of Using Redux
Using Redux provides several benefits, including:

- Predictable state changes: Redux ensures that state changes are predictable and follow a strict set of rules.
- Easier debugging: Redux makes it easier to debug the application by providing a clear understanding of state changes.
- Improved scalability: Redux helps to improve the scalability of the application by providing a centralized store for managing global state.
